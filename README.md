# Simploy - A Custom WordPress Theme

Simploy is a custom WordPress theme designed to be responsive, lightweight, and easy to use. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and the Bootstrap framework. Each section of the theme is built as a separate component for easy customization and scalability.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Component-Based Structure**: Each section of the theme is divided into individual components, making it modular and easy to maintain.
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Bootstrap is the only library used in this project, providing a flexible grid system and pre-designed components.
- **Custom Scripts and Styles**: Scripts and styles are properly enqueued, ensuring optimized performance and compatibility.
- **Cross-Browser Compatible**: Works on all major browsers.

## Installation

1. Download or clone the repository to your `wp-content/themes` directory:
    ```bash
        https://github.com/mehrabbahramian/simploy.git
    ```
2. Log in to your WordPress admin panel.
3. Navigate to Appearance > Themes.
4. Locate the theme in the available themes list and activate it.

## Development

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: The front-end is developed using these core technologies with the addition of Bootstrap for responsiveness.
- PHP: PHP is used for the server-side logic and integration with WordPress.
- Enqueued Scripts and Styles: All necessary scripts and styles are enqueued properly within WordPress to avoid conflicts with other plugins or themes.

## Usage

To customize the theme, simply edit the relevant component files located in the /components directory. Each component corresponds to a specific part of the theme, such as the header, footer, or sidebar.
